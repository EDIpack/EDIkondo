# ED_Kondo: An Exact Diagonalization algorithm to solve a general Kondo problem. 

This is a beta version softwware.

A Lanczos based solver for Kondo problem exploiting distributed memory MPI parallelisation. 

### Dependencies

The code is written around the SciFortran library. Dependencies are:   

* gfortran > 11.0.0 **OR** ifort  > 13.0
* cmake > 3.0.0    
* [MPI](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi)
* [SciFortran](https://github.com/QcmPlab/SciFortran)


### Installation
Installation is  available using CMake.    

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/QcmPlab/ED_Kondo`

and from the just created directory make a standard out-of-source CMake compilation:

`mkdir build`  
 `cd build`  
`cmake ..`     
`make`     
`make install`   

The `CMake` compilation can be controlled using the following additional variables, default values between `< >`:   

* `-DPREFIX=prefix directory <~/opt/>` 
* `-DUSE_MPI=<yes>/no`  
* `-DVERBOSE=yes/<no> `  
* `-DBUILD_TYPE=<RELEASE>/TESTING/DEBUG`  

### System loading: 

The library can be loaded into the operative system using one of the following, automatically generated, methods:    

* environment module file `~/.modules.d/ed_kondo/<PLAT>`  
* homebrew `bash` script `<PREFIX>/etc/config_ed_kondo.sh`
* pkg-config file in `~/.pkg-config.d/ed_kondo.pc`


Method 2. has the advantage of making `uninstall` operation feasible. 

### Uninstall

The library is removed with the command:

`make uninstall`

from the same building directory as for the installation part.
